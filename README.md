# Black Box — Logic Board Game (Java TUI)

Black Box is a **two-player logic and deduction game** implemented in Java with a **Text-Based User Interface (TUI)**.  
Players take turns firing "rays" into the board to deduce the hidden positions of atoms. The goal is to determine their locations using logic based on how the rays reflect, are absorbed, or pass through the grid.

## 🎮 Features

- Two-player alternating gameplay
- TUI rendering in the terminal
- Scoreboard displayed at the end of rounds
- Developer mode to reveal hidden atom locations (for debugging/testing)
- Customizable board layout and atom placement rules

## 🧠 My Contribution (What *I* Built)
I was responsible for implementing the **core game logic**, including:

- The internal representation of the board and atom positions
- The ray tracing logic (reflection, absorption, and pass-through mechanics)
- Turn progression rules and score calculation
- Validating moves and enforcing game rules

This means I worked on the system that ensures the game *behaves correctly and fairly*, based on the classic Black Box rules.
